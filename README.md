# XOR with Tensorflow.js
## About
A simple example on Tensorflow.js. I've implemented a `neural network` which will predict the outputs of `XOR gate`.

## How to do it ?
I've written a very simple article on how to do this. You can find it [here](https://blog.yellowant.com/tensorflow-js-a-practical-guide-2ed58327c455).
